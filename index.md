<br /> <br /> I seek to promote synergy between new technologies and classical strategies for developing disruptive solutions to face modern society's challenges, focusing on merging Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Control, Systems Optimization, Digitalization, and Automation working together to promote a new and sustainable industry. I see multidisciplinarity and collaboration with other fields and perspectives as essential to developing these research branches. This way, I collaborate with several universities, institutes, and industries worldwide. Furthermore, I am also pursuing the promotion, research, and development of innovative teaching strategies to prepare future engineers to face the challenges of Industry 4.0/5.0. Overall, I list my research in five main branches:
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
- **Artificial Intelligence** aims to develop AI solutions to solve complex chemical process issues, such as simulation, prediction, soft sensors, and fault detection, thus providing a reliable source of real-time information. Furthermore, it focuses on developing and employing cutting-edge supervised and unsupervised solutions to promote autonomy and self-management abilities in chemical plants. This branch also focuses on developing a hybrid model, harnessing the potentialities of AI and the robustness of first principle models.
- **Advanced Process Control** covers the development of controllers with guaranteed stability and stable integration with the Real-time Optimization (RTO) layer for complex chemical processes. Model uncertainty is included using robust formulations. Furthermore, these controllers are developed to accommodate AI models to improve their performance.
-  **Processes Optimization** concerns the development of solutions for real-time economic optimization of cyclic adsorption separation processes. The focus is to develop a methodology for implementing RTO formulations (single or multi-objective) for complex chemical processes based on AI surrogate models, coupled with industrial units' safety, economic, and environmental constraints.
- **Processes Automation and Digitalization** regard developing solutions for the automation of chemical units to promote the integration between the other branches of my research and the physical processes. It focuses on consolidating concise cyber-physical systems and exploring their potentialities through their cloning into digital twins. This branch serves as a backbone to support the integration of my research with its application domain.
- **Experimental Developments** covers the practical issues related to chemical processes to develop simplified uncertainty-based experimental procedures. It aims to determine a trustworthy, reliable, and precise model. It considers the uncertainty evaluation a critical tool that allows the model identification and validation with a few experiments while leading to high-precision predictions. This provides a robust basis for the development of the other branches.
