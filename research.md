<br /> I seek to promote synergy between new technologies and classical strategies for developing disruptive solutions to face modern society's challenges, focusing on merging artificial intelligence, advanced control, systems optimization, digitalization and automation. My research has four main branches working together to promote a new and sustainable industry. I call the synergy between these branches, AiP2S2 (Artificial Intelligence-powered Products, Processes, Scales and Systems). I can briefly list them as follows:
<br /> 
<br />  
- **Developing Products:** This branch seeks to develop new products using the Process Systems Engineering perspective. The main question is: How can Artificial Intelligence and Control theory be used to prospect new product solutions never seen before?
- **Operating Processes:** This branch addresses two main questions. The first one is: How can Artificial Intelligence be developed in an interpretable, robust and reliable way to help Process System Engineering in an Industry 4.0/5.0 scenario? The second question is: How can we combine Systems Control, Optimization and Artificial Intelligence while guaranteeing stability, robustness and stable integration?
-  **Bridging Scales:** This branch develops a new way to observe the systemâ€”a way to consider the phenomena and the process in the same frame. Thus, the main question here is: How to integrate the processes' fundamental, design and operating scales to optimize and control both simultaneously?
- **Connecting Systems:** We live in a dynamic society that requires solutions for its challenges in time. How can the industry quickly adapt to face these challenges? This is the question that we want to solve at this branch.

<br />  I see multidisciplinarity and collaboration with other fields and perspectives as essential to developing these research branches. In this way, I m collaborating with several universities, institutes and industries worldwide. Furthermore, I am also pursuing the promotion of innovative teaching activities to prepare future engineers to face the Industry 4.0/5.0 challenges.
